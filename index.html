                        So a quick intro to Zova. Its a fitness application for iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
                        Our latest claim to fame is that we scored an Apple Design Award at WWDC last year for our tv application.
                        That application was about 50% rxswift-based at the time, which I guess proves that functional programming and sexy apps can be a thing.
                        <p>So what does it mean to have a bunch of fitness apps?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Well the oldest and most fundamental feature of the apps (except for the watch): a video player for workouts</li>
                            <li>Then, a companion watch application. There is a lot of message passing and state transfer involved in making the watch app function, and it isn't necessarily timely or reliable. The watch app itself talks to both the phone and the tv apps simultaneously sometimes.</li>
                            <li>A recent addition has been a scoring mechanism, which eats data from a few sources on the phone continously, providing an aggregated number</lib>
                        </ul>
                        I'm proud to say now that all three apps are 100% built around RxSwift. Why do I think this is a good thing? Lets go back a year

                           So with the rewrite to swift, came a good opportunity to do something about these issues. Now functional programming and mobile applications tend not to be two things you associate with each other. Maybe Scala on Android? There's a good reason though, as you multiplex your network requests, user input, ui updates, and animations its pretty hard to keep your app  functional outside of little snippets of maps and filters. So how can we reap the benefits of a more functional architecture?</aside>

                       As observables are pure, by themselves they're not incredibly useful to our users. They would just see white screens. Then probably rate the app 1 star. Not good.
                       To do some work based on our observable, we need to subscribe to it. In fact an observable wont even be computed unless it is subscribed to.
                        Subscribing to an observable is the process of attaching an observer, so that it recieves a notification of each new value emitted by the observable.
                        This is where your side effects will live.

                    which is essentially the iOS AVPlayer widget being fed a playlist of streams to play.
                    Then either below it or overlayed, depending on screen orientation, we have the hud, showing what exercise you're on, what rep within that exercise, and what's coming up next, among other things.
                    And in between exercises we display intro segments, displaying info about the upcoming exercise, while actually pausing the video player underneath.

This calls for a reactive UI. The iOS video player exposes a variety of notifications to make it possible to build one around it. Unfortunately iOS doesn't help us here in that it uses three different mechanisms to notify the developer of changes to the video player's state. This is a place where rx shines, as we can encapsulate each of the notification mechanisms in observables, providing us with both a consistent api, and a library of functional operators with which to build our reactive ui.</aside>

                    <aside class="notes">Another area of the app where usage of rx comes into its own is in our calculation of the user's activity score. The score is a number providing an insight into how active someone currently is as a whole. It calculates this by aggregating the user's activity from a variety of sources, and for each activity weighting it by its age, finally reducing the data together. What makes this interesting is that this data needs to be extracted from a multitude of sources asynchronously so as not to block the ui, with each source taking an undetermined amount of time to return. On top of that, the score is dependent on time, so we would like it to update as time passes. Just to add some more complication</aside>

                    <aside class="notes">Now it all comes to a crux with our ability to represent an entire screen as not just through a set of observables, but as a single observable.

Let's go back to our hypothetical login screen for the lambdajam cool people club. Our user attempts to log in, upon which the app communicate with the backend and determine access. This doesn't happen instantly, so we want to reflect our loading state to the user. On top of that, maybe they're not cool enough to log in.
